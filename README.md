#### How To Use Git For Your Homework
[![How to fork this
repo](https://github-images.s3.amazonaws.com/help/Bootcamp-Fork.png)](../../fork)

To get started, [fork this repo](../../fork) to the github account of ONE of your group
memebers to create a new repository for your group (We'll call this person the
*repository owner*). 


The repository owner should then [add the other group members as
github collaborators](https://help.github.com/articles/how-do-i-add-a-collaborator). 

Each person in the group should clone the repo to their local machine

```
# Get the URL from the repository owner's repo as usual. It will be of the form
git clone git@github.com:<username>/<assignment>.git 
# Clones your fork of the repository into the current directory in terminal
```

```
# pull, work, commit, and push to the repository as per the normal github
# workflow
git add .
git commit -m "Description of change made"
git push origin master
```

#### Submitting
* To submit the homework, make your final commits, then have the repository
"owner" issue a [Pull
Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) within github.
