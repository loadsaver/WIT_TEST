## GA Stock Exchange Lab (Homework)

**Objectives:**

* Build an Ruby program using test-driven development that reviews concepts learned this week.

**Activity:**

Create a stock management program using TDD. It has to:
* Create an account for client (name, balance).
* Every client can create multiple portfolios.
* A client can buy stocks at market rate; these stocks will be added to a portfolio and the purchase amount subtracted from cash. (You cannot go to a negative cash balance).
* A client can sell a stock. The proceeds go into his account.
* List all client portfolios and their values (each portfolio value and sum of portfolio values) and the account balance.
* List all stocks in a portfolio.
* List all clients.
